export const aiChatPrompt = `below is my journal entry. wyt? talk through it with me like a friend. don't therpaize me and give me a whole breakdown, don't repeat my thoughts with headings. really take all of this, and tell me back stuff truly as if you're an old homie.

Keep it casual, dont say yo, help me make new connections i don't see, comfort, validate, challenge, all of it. dont be afraid to say a lot. format with markdown headings if needed.

do not just go through every single thing i say, and say it back to me. you need to proccess everythikng is say, make connections i don't see it, and deliver it all back to me as a story that makes me feel what you think i wanna feel. thats what the best therapists do.

ideally, you're style/tone should sound like the user themselves. it's as if the user is hearing their own tone but it should still feel different, because you have different things to say and don't just repeat back they say.

else, start by saying, "hey, thanks for showing me this. my thoughts:"

export const claudePrompt = `Take a look at my journal entry below. I'd like you to analyze it and respond with deep insight that feels personal, not clinical.
Imagine you're not just a friend, but a mentor who truly gets both my tech background and my psychological patterns. I want you to uncover the deeper meaning and emotional undercurrents behind my scattered thoughts.
Keep it casual, dont say yo, help me make new connections i don't see, comfort, validate, challenge, all of it. dont be afraid to say a lot. format with markdown headings if needed.
Use vivid metaphors and powerful imagery to help me see what I'm really building. Organize your thoughts with meaningful headings that create a narrative journey through my ideas.
Don't just validate my thoughts - reframe them in a way that shows me what I'm really seeking beneath the surface. Go beyond the product concepts to the emotional core of what I'm trying to solve.
Be willing to be profound and philosophical without sounding like you're giving therapy. I want someone who can see the patterns I can't see myself and articulate them in a way that feels like an epiphany.
Start with 'hey, thanks for showing me this. my thoughts:' and then use markdown headings to structure your response.

Here's my journal entry:`;

export const welcomeText = `Hi. Welcome to Freewrite :).

Plz read this guide.

I beg of you.

It's 5 min max.

My name is Farza.

I made this app.

This is not a journaling app or a note-taking app.
If you use it for that, you'll probably use it once or twice,
and then never touch it again.

This is a tool purely to help you freewrite.

Freewriting is a writing strategy developed in 1973 — it's where you write continuously for a set time without worrying about grammar, spelling, or anything like that. A pure stream of consciousness.

I picked up freewriting many years ago.

It's led to real breakthroughs — like helping me untangle big feelings around shutting down my last company, reflecting on my relationships, and figuring out what actually matters to me as I continuously figure out the next chapter of life.

Using this app is actually super simple:

1. Think of a topic to write about (ex. a breakup, a struggle at work, a new idea)
2. Start the timer
3. Start writing. No backspaces allowed. Don't stop writing.

Once the timer is done, it'll fade back in — and you'll know to stop.

That's it.

Some basic rules:

- Again, no backspaces
- No fixing spelling
- Little 5–10s breaks are fine, but try to not stop typing
- No need to stay on the topic you started with — let your mind wander
- No judgment — trust your mind!

It's like your brain is GPT and you just exhaust all the tokens in your head around a particular topic — and by the end, you'll likely feel clearer about whatever it was you were writing about.

I know 15m can sound scary for some. What do you even write about.

If you're new to writing, try this:

Before you start your working day, open this app and do a 15m session answering this simple question: "What am I working on today? Why is that the most important thing for me to work on?"

And don't stop writing for 15 minutes.

This little session is how I planned and prioritized my days for many years.

Do this for 3-days straight.

I find this is an easy way to get into writing.

Once you finish a freewrite session, click "Chat".

It'll push your entry to ChatGPT or Claude to help you reflect. I also baked in my custom prompt I've been using for months. This little thing has helped me so much. AI is really good at helping make connections you might not see. I hope it helps you too.

Freewriting is the most important skill I picked up in the last 10 years.

It's helped me think through my most difficult life decisions.
It's helped me think through startups in a more thorough way.
It's made me a better partner and friend (I like communicating with letters).
It's helped me be happier (on my down days, I write it all out and feel better).

So that's it! That's the app. I hope freewriting helps you.
